# Matrix Operations Library - Chingyen Huang

This repository contains a C++ project for performing basic matrix operations such as multiplication and transposition. The project demonstrates the use of C++ in developing a linear algebra library without external dependencies.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Huang-Chingyen_main.cpp`: The main C++ file that includes the driver code to demonstrate matrix operations.
- `Huang-Chingyen_MatrixLib.h`: The header file containing the definition of the `Chingyen_Matrix` class, which supports operations like matrix multiplication and transposition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++11. This project was tested using `g++`, which can be installed on most operating systems.

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacob7123/Chingyen_Matrix.git

#Building the Project
You can compile the project using g++ with the following command:
```bash
g++ -o MatrixApp Huang-Chingyen_main.cpp -I. -std=c++11
